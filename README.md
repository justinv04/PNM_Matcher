### This project was created for the purpose of pairing the Potential New Members (PNMs) with the active members of the Theta Tau Tau Beta chapter each week as a part of the PNM Pal program

### It can handle repeats in member names, and will create pairs without duplicates (including with repeated members) and store them in a storage file for future reference.
